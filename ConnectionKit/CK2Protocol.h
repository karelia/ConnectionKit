#pragma mark Registration

/*!
 @method registerClass:
 @abstract This method registers a protocol class, making it visible
 to several other CK2Protocol class methods.
 @discussion When the system begins to perform an operation,
 each protocol class that has been registered is consulted in turn to
 see if it can be initialized with a given request. The first
 protocol handler class to provide a YES answer to
 <tt>+canHandleURL:</tt> "wins" and that protocol
 implementation is used to perform the URL load. There is no
 guarantee that all registered protocol classes will be consulted.
 Hence, it should be noted that registering a class places it first
 on the list of classes that will be consulted in calls to
 <tt>+canHandleURL:</tt>, moving it in front of all classes
 that had been registered previously.
 Throws an exception if protocolClass isn't a subclass of CK2Protocol
 @param protocolClass the class to register.
