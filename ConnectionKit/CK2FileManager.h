/**
 ConnectionKit's equivalent of NSFileManager
 All operations are asynchronous, including ones on the local file system.
 Supports remote file servers, currently over FTP, SFTP and WebDAV.
 Allocate and initialise as many file managers as you wish; there is no +defaultManager method
 Provide a file manager with a delegate to handle authentication in the same fashion as NSURLConnection
 Behind the scenes, ConnectionKit takes care of creating as many connections to
 servers as are needed. This means you can perform multiple operations at once,
 but please avoid performing too many at once as that could easily upset a
 server.
 
 Supported protocols and their URL schemes:
 
 Scheme | Protocol
 ------ | --------
 file   | Local files
 ftp    | FTP
 ftps   | FTP with Implicit SSL
 ftpes  | FTP with TLS/SSL
 http   | WebDAV
 https  | WebDAV over HTTPS
 sftp   | SFTP

#pragma mark Discovering Directory Contents

/**
 Performs a shallow search of the specified directory and returns URLs for the contained items.
 
 This method performs a shallow search of the directory and therefore does not traverse symbolic links or return the contents of any subdirectories. This method also does not return URLs for the current directory (“.”), parent directory (“..”) but it can return hidden files (files that begin with a period character)
 
 The order of the files in the returned array generally follows that returned by the server, which is likely undefined.
 
 Paths are standardized if possible (i.e. case is corrected if needed, and relative paths resolved).
 
 Many protocols provide a decent error code indicating *why* the operation
 failed. Unfortunately, FTP cannot. The FTP spec means the only machine-readable
 response is a 550 code. This covers pretty much any sort of filesystem access
 problem (as opposed to an issue with the connection itself). Thus FTP ops
 cannot distinguish between a folder not existing, not actually being a folder,
 and the user having insufficient permissions to access it. Instead you'll get
 back plain old `NSFileReadUnknownError`.
 
 @param url for the directory whose contents you want to enumerate.
 @param keys to try and include from the server. Pass nil to get a default set. Include NSURLParentDirectoryURLKey to get 
 @param mask of options. In addition to NSDirectoryEnumerationOptions, accepts CK2DirectoryEnumerationIncludesDirectory
 @param block called with URLs, each of which identifies a file, directory, or symbolic link. If the directory contains no entries, the array is empty. If an error occurs, contents is nil and error should be non-nil.
 @return An opaque token object representing the operation for passing to `-cancelOperation:` if needed.

 Only some protocols/servers support/respect applying attributes to a directory
 as part of creating it. Indeed, some servers don't really support attributes at

 - WebDAV: Attributes are ignored
 - file:   The full suite of attributes supported by `NSFileManager` should be available

 follow-up call to -setAttributes:… is needed.
 
 Note: Even though this is a "write" operation, it is still possible to get back
 something like `NSFileReadUnknownError`. In particular, FTP must traverse the
 directory hierarchy which can fail if the target directory turns out not to
 exist, or the user has insufficient permissions to access it.

@interface CK2FileManager (URLs)

/**
 Initializes and returns a newly created NSURL object by changing `baseURL` to the specified path.
 
 Some protocols differentiate between absolute paths, and those relative to the
 user's home directory. This method constructs URLs to accomodate that and the
 quirks of different protocols. Here are some example URLs:
 
 Protocol | `/absolute` path              | `relative` path
 -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------
 HTTP     | `http://example.com/absolute` | `http://example.com/relative`
 FTP      | `ftp://example.com//absolute` | `ftp://example.com/relative`
 SSH      | `sftp://example.com/absolute` | `sftp://example.com/~/relative`
 
 There is a subtle bug in 10.6's handling of relative file URLs. This method
 stops it hitting you.
 
 @param path The path that the NSURL object will represent. If path is a relative path, it is treated as being relative to the user's home directory once connected to `baseURL`. Passing nil for this parameter produces an exception.
 @param isDir A Boolean value that specifies whether path is treated as a directory path when resolving against relative path components. Pass YES if the path indicates a directory, NO otherwise.
 @param baseURL A URL providing at least a scheme and host for the result to be based on. Any path as part of this URL is ignored.
 @return An NSURL object initialized with path. `nil` if `baseURL` proved unsuitable.

 Extracts the path component of a URL, accounting for the subtleties of FTP etc.
 
 Normally, paths in URLs are absolute. FTP and SSH-based protocols both have the
 concept of a "home" directory though. i.e. the working directory upon login.
 Thus, their URLs must distinguish between absolute and relative paths
 (the latter are interpreted relative to the home directory). This method makes
 that same distinction to return an absolute or relative path, as interpreted
 by the specific protocol. Some examples:
 
 ftp://example.com/relative      =>  relative
 ftp://example.com//absolute     =>  /absolute
 sftp://example.com/absolute     =>  /absolute
 sftp://example.com/~/relative   =>  relative
